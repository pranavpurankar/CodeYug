'''
Why we're creating multiple classes for the cars. It is because we cannot create
the object of the Abstract claas. You can't create c1=Car() always keep in mind

â€£ How can we call this methods?
  We can call this methods by using the objects of Maruti_Suzuki, TATA, Duster
'''
m1 = Maruti_Suzuki()
t1 = TATA()
d1 = Duster()
m1.mileage()
d1.mileage()
t1.mileage()

'''
What is the real world use case creating signature method and then sub classes
for each vehicle?
